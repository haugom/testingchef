Playing ground.

Experimenting
- building a docker image with chef-client and chefdk.
- starting docker instance with chef-client.
- running chef-client in local-mode with recipies in current directory.

Inspired by tutorial:
https://learn.chef.io/modules/learn-the-basics/ubuntu/virtualbox/make-your-recipe-more-manageable#/

instead of provision a new vagrant virtualbox, I tried to do the tutorial installing in an ubuntu 16.04 docker instance.
